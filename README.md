## Socket Library

The socket library provides low-level networking capabilities. It allows you to create sockets for communication between processes. Here's a basic example of a Python server-client communication using the `socket` library. The server will listen for incoming connections, and the client will connect to the server and send a message.

**Implementation**

1. Save the server script in a file, e.g., `server.py`.
2. Save the client script in another file, e.g., `client.py`.
3. Open two terminal windows.
4. In the first terminal, run `python server.py` to start the server.
5. In the second terminal, run `python client.py` to start the client.

    You should see output indicating that the client sends a message, the server receives it, and then echoes it back to the client.

- Both the `server.py` and `client.py` are present in the repo
